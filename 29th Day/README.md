Vanilla Array
An array is called vanilla if all its elements are made up of the same digit. For example {1, 1, 11, 1111, 1111111} is a vanilla array because all its elements use only the digit 1. However, the array {11, 101, 1111, 11111} is not a vanilla array because its elements use the digits 0 and 1.
